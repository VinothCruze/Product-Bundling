# Product-Bundling
Master thesis code for the development of product bundling recommendation algorithm with Neural Collaborative filtering, Alternate Least Square, Frequent itemset mining, and Item-item collaborative filtering. The visualization part for dispalying the assocaition rules and model interpretability cases for the neural collaborative filtering approach. The repository contains files from the code that removes certain part of the project as per Wuerth.

1. Recommender system code file have the code for Neural Collaborative filtering, Alternate Least Square, Frequent itemset mining, and Item-item collaborative filtering.
2. Flask application have the files necessary for the visualization tool that was developed for the NCF model interpretability and associative rule network graph display.
